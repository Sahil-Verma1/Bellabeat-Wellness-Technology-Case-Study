Project Title: Bellabeat Wellness Technology Case Study

Project Overview: I completed an in-depth analysis of the Bellabeat fitness tracker dataset to provide data-driven recommendations for the marketing team. This analysis was part of my case study for a wellness technology company that aimed to understand customer activity patterns and improve their product targeting.

Tools & Technologies:

Programming Language: R
Libraries: tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2
Data Visualization: Bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, pie charts
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Handled inconsistent data using dplyr functions like mutate, coalesce, and performed joins to combine datasets. Ensured data reliability by eliminating irrelevant entries.
Data Sources:

Activity and sleep data from Fitbit, including variables like step counts, distance traveled, minutes in different activity levels, and sleep duration.
Key Insights:

Activity Patterns: Users showed more activity on weekdays, with higher activity on Saturdays and Tuesdays, while Sundays had the least activity.
Activity Preferences: Most users engaged in light activities rather than vigorous exercise, indicating a potential focus on working professionals or busy individuals.
Sleep Analysis: Users spent a significant amount of time in bed without sleeping, possibly indicating stress, which could help in designing stress management features.
Customer Targeting: Based on activity trends, it was recommended to target working women and professionals, who tend to prefer light activity over intensive workouts.
Visualizations:

Activity Summary: Created visualizations showing users' daily and weekly activity trends, highlighting their preferred activity levels.
Sleep Patterns: Analyzed sleep quality by comparing time in bed and time asleep, uncovering potential issues related to stress and rest.
Polar Area Chart: Displayed the proportion of time spent in different activity levels (sedentary, lightly active, fairly active, and very active) to give a clear picture of user habits.
Conclusion: This project helped Bellabeat better understand user activity and sleep patterns, leading to targeted marketing strategies and insights into potential product features, such as stress management tools for professionals.
